# NYT-Scraper

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

Whenever a user visits your site, the app should scrape stories from a news outlet of your choice and display them for the user.

Users should also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later.
